## DETAILS ON DELIVERABLES FOR THE COURSE:

### Intermediate Deliverables

1. Progress Report I

2. Progress Report II


Details: The progress reports can build from the Project Plan. They should include the same sections at a **minimum**, listed here:

- Stakeholder Names and Roles
- Project Title
- Abstract
- Outline of the Project
- Success Criteria
- Assumptions and Limitations
- Background Literature and Resources
- Brief Outline of the Data
- Overview of Data Modeling and Processing
  - What is working / not working
- Overview of Modeling Approaches
  - What is working / not working
- Computing
  - What resources are you using for compute? (e.g., Rivanna, sponsor resources)  
  - How are you storing data (e.g., RDS database on AWS, flat files on Rivanna)
- Concerns and Blockers

NOTE:  
*Concerns* are things to keep in mind but might not yet impede progress  
*Blockers* indicate that you are stuck and need help

### Final Deliverables

**3. Package containing all data products and research artifacts**
   - To be shared with clients and other stakeholders
   - Students should coordinate with stakeholders to determine best method for delivery 
   - Students to answer sponsor questions about deliverables

---

**4. Publishable paper**
   - Length: 6 pages maximum
   - The paper will summarize the research and findings
   - Submit the file on Canvas
   - Publication is not a requirement but it is encouraged!
   - See paper [rubric](https://github.com/UVADS/ds6015/blob/main/rubrics/rubric_paper.md) for grading breakdown
   
   **Authors**  
   - Clients are cited as authors only if they make a direct contribution to the paper
   - Capstone advisors are occasionally listed as authors. If so, they are listed last. Include them **only** if they made a direct contribution to the paper **and** if they wish to be included.

   **Acknowledgments**  
   - All contributors not listed authors should be mentioned in an acknowledgments note.  
   - Clients may opt out of this. Be sure to ask your clients if they want to be acknowledged.  

   **Citing Work**
   - As a rule, all written or presented material must be your own unless you explicitly cite the work of others
   - You may not copy or use the work of anyone else without proper citation
   
   **Voice and Style**
   - Do not use the first person. Use either second person plural (“we”) of passive voice where appropriate.
   - Use direct and simple language.

   **Code**
   - Name all important code packages used

   **Figures and Tables**
   - Use block diagrams to describe data flow (pipeline) when appropriate
   - Show mathematical formulae for core methods
   - Tables should be legible and within the page’s columns
   - Figures should be labeled clearly, crisp, and readable

   **Outline**  
   The sections listed below are often included in capstone papers.  
   In some cases, you may consolidate the sections.

   - Introduction / Project Goal / Research Questions
   - Literature Review / Background / Related Work
   - Data Description
   - Methodology
   - Results
   - Discussion
   - Conclusion / Future Work / Recommendations
   - Acknowledgements
